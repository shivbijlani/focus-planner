.SYNOPSIS
  Skill-owned memory for the Overnight Agent. Tracks, per task, what the agent has
  already processed in each journal — so a user message appended at the BOTTOM of a
  journal (the natural way the Focus Planner app journals) reliably reopens the task.

.WHY
  The journal .md is the only thing the user touches; it stays pure prose. NO machine
  metadata lives in it. All structured state lives HERE, in the skill's own working dir
  ($env:LOCALAPPDATA\overnight-agent\state), which is local and never OneDrive-synced
  (so it can't hit the planner's sync-conflict bug). The user never sees or edits any of it.

.MODEL
  "Has the USER changed this journal since I last wrote to it?"  ==  reopen.
  We answer it by hashing the journal and remembering the hash the agent left behind:
    - reopened = current-file-hash != processed_file_hash   (the user/app edited it)
    - on first sight of a journal (no state yet), reopened = there is user prose AFTER
      the agent's last block (catches already-reopened tasks like #293 on the first run).
  The agent calls `mark` after it writes its turn, which re-snapshots the hash.

  "The user" means the human, `<!-- from: me -->`, and nothing else. These journals are
  shared: sibling skills (dance-church, instagram-publisher-monitor, kranbox-backup, ...)
  append their own turns with their own `<!-- from: ... -->` stamps. Those are machine
  turns. Counting one as user prose pins the task at `reopened` permanently -- there is no
  human message to answer, and the sibling skill re-appends on its own schedule.

.COMMANDS
  seed   [-Force]                Initialise state for every journal (one-time / migration).
  scan                          Emit the per-run worklist as JSON (what changed / reopened).
  get    -Id <id>               Print one task's state JSON.
  mark   -Id <id> [-Status s] [-Version n] [-PlanId p]
                                Record that the agent has processed the journal as it now
                                stands (re-snapshots processed_file_hash + updates fields).

.EXAMPLES
  pwsh oa-state.ps1 seed
  pwsh oa-state.ps1 scan
  pwsh oa-state.ps1 get  -Id 293
  pwsh oa-state.ps1 mark -Id 305 -Status proposed -Version 1 -PlanId t305-v1

# (`dance-church`, `instagram-publisher-monitor`, `kranbox-backup`, ...).

# --- The turn terminator ---------------------------------------------------------------
# An HTML comment (invisible when the journal renders) that marks the exact END of this
# agent's turn. `mark` writes it; `Get-AgentEndIndex` trusts it.
#
# WHY IT EXISTS. Without it the end of the agent's turn is found by scanning FORWARD for
# the next `## ` heading, and when the agent's turn is the newest -- the normal state --
# there is no such heading, so the boundary falls to EOF and the WHOLE FILE counts as the
# agent's turn. A reply typed at the bottom with no `## <date>` heading therefore lands
# INSIDE the agent's own turn and is never seen.
#
# That is the dangerous direction. A false "reopened" costs one needless look; a false
# "already answered" silently swallows the user's message with no trace anywhere. It is
# not hypothetical: task #426580 sat for a day with two unanswered questions
# ("were you able to ... create the event in Google calendar?") appended exactly this way,
# and 216 of 239 live journals were in the same shape.
#
# The boundary is genuinely ambiguous from CONTENT alone -- an agent turn may legitimately
# end in a plain prose paragraph, which is indistinguishable from a short human reply. So
# the fix is not a cleverer heuristic; it is to stop guessing and write the boundary down
# at the moment the agent already knows it.

# agent writes it, so it is a reliable machine-turn marker even in the many historical
# journals where the agent replied without stamping a `<!-- from: overnight-agent -->`
# provenance marker at all.
#
# The trailing `\r?` is load-bearing: these journals round-trip through OneDrive and the
# planner web app, so CRLF is common. `$` in .NET multiline mode matches before the `\n`,
# which leaves the `\r` unconsumed -- and `[ \t]` does not match `\r`. Without it the

  # apostrophe repair) flips `changed` and the task false-reopens with a message that was
